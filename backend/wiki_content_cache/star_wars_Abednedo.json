    "biography": "Abednedos evolved from an underground precursor species. They carved out a series of interconnected tunnel-dens, or warrens, to create massive cathedrals, which housed tens of thousands of family units.\nAt some point, the precursor species evolved into the Abednedo, and they began to start living on the surface of their planet. There, they built multiple cities, spanning the surface of Abednedo. The cities were endless sources of amusement and interest for Abednedos, but in contrast, could strike outsiders as chaotic, due to them including many ornamental spires, flagpoles, and riotously colored carvings.\nShortly after the Battle of Endor, due to their allegiance to the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the Empire occupied Abednedo, and the planet was subject to a climate disruption array. As such, they later elected to become part of the New Republic. After the Resistance was formed by General Leia Organa, the Abednedo were early supporters of Organa, and eventually several Abednedo joined the Resistance.",
